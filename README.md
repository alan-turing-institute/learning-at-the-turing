#  The Alan Turing Institute: Learning at the Turing 

**Vision**

This project aims to develop an online open-access tool to encourage and offer a platform for researchers to contribute to the national data science and AI training agenda. The long term goal is to enable a more inclusive environment, and to improve the training provision nationally and beyond.

**About**

As the national institute for data science and AI in the UK, and established in the aim of becoming better than the sum of the parts (the university and business partners), we are well placed to co-develop innovative training with the wider community in order to set educational standards, and to offer a wide range of training opportunities for anyone interested in learning more about data science and AI.

Training is often developed and delivered in silos. As a national institute in data science and AI, we are unable to deliver training to everyone interested in it if we donâ€™t adopt a train-the-trainer approach. Also, we are moving toward involving external contributors in shaping out the training strategy and materials. 

Through this project, we want to offer a platform through which  community contributors can find guidance and tools to contribute to training.

### Contributing

This repository is always a work in progress and **everyone** is encouraged to help us develop and deliver training resources that will be useful to the wider community of learners.

**How can I get involved?**

- **Suggest training ideas:** Have an idea for some training that you and/ or others would find useful? Let us know.
- **Design a training activity:** Do you have an idea and the domain expertise to design a training activity or resource, but you don't have the time to actually develop the training materials? We want to hear about it.
- **Develop training materials:** Do you have some spare time and would like to contribute to open education? We would love to have you on board.
- **Deliver training in your community**: Would you like to use any of the training resources part of the Learning at the Turing portfolio? Feel free to use them as you see suited, and let us know if and how you may have found them useful!
- **Peer Review:** Do you know a bit about a certain training topic? Do you have some time to go through the existing materials and would like raise any issues, bugs, update the examples we use? We are keen to hear from you - peer-reviewers are crucial to this training.
- **Make open your ready-made training materials:** Do you have some training which is ready to share with the open community? We welcome any training ideas that align with the topics of interest.
