#  The Alan Turing Institute: Towards an open infrastructure for training in data science and AI

**Vision**

This project aims to develop an online open-access tool to encourage and offer a platform for researchers to contribute to the national data science and AI training agenda. The long term goal is enabling a more inclusive environment, and improving the training provision nationally and beyond.

**About**

As the national institute for data science and AI in the UK, and established in the aim of becoming better than the sum of the parts (the university and business partners), we are well placed to co-develop innovative training with the wider community in order to set the standards for training.

Training is often developed and delivered in silos. As a national institute in data science and AI, we are unable to deliver training to everyone interested in it if we donâ€™t adopt a train-the-trainer approach. Also, we are moving toward involving external contributors in shaping out the training strategy and materials. 

Through this project, we want to offer a platform through which  community contributors can find guidance and tools to contribute to training.

**Who can contribute?**

Anyone who can 1) design, 2) develop, 3) deliver, 4) peer-review, 5) update training (materials), or a combination of the above.
